# Paintings by Google

A simple program that takes a search query, fetches images from Google and trains a neural network to paint the results.

## Example: the face of AI

How does the face of AI look? Let's see what Google thinks by searching for 'ai+face', and then train a network to paint the results.

## Run any query

Run the jupyter notebook or the python scripts and test your own queries.
